Problem Definition
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In 2013, Yelp.com has announced the “Yelp Dataset Challenge” and invited students to use this data 
in an innovative way and break ground in research. In this project you would query this dataset to 
extract useful information for local businesses and individual users.

The Yelp data is available in JSON format. The original Yelp dataset includes 42,153 businesses, 
252,898 users, and 1,125,458 reviews from Phoenix (AZ), Las Vegas (NV), Madison (WI) in United States 
and Waterloo (ON) and Edinburgh (ON) in Canada. (http://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge/). 

In your project you will use a smaller and simplified dataset. This simplified dataset includes only 
20,544 businesses, the reviews that are written for those businesses only, and the users that wrote 
those reviews.

Overview & Requirements:
You would develop a target application which runs queries on the Yelp data and extracts useful 
information. The primary users for this application will be potential customers seeking for businesses
that match their search criteria. Your application will have a user interface that provides the user the
available business categories (main and sub-categories) and the attributes associated with each business
category. Using this application the user will search for the businesses from various business categories 
that have the properties (attributes) the user is looking for. The user can filter the search results by 
state, city or zipcode. In addition, the user may choose to view only the businesses that are open or closed on 
certain days of the week. The application should also allow the user to view the reviews provided for 
each business.
